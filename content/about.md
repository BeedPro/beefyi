# Welcome!

I'm Beed and this is **beefyi** - short for _Beed For Your Info_. I'm currently an undergraduate student studying Computer Science with a strong interest in libre software, academia, and just about anything that sparks interest. I believe in the lifelong pursuit of knowledge - learning should never have a limit.

So my main goal with beefyi is to be my own corner of the internet: a place to share what I've learned, document my thoughts, and express ideas throughout the years. It's a digitial space where I explore topics that interest me, reflect on what I'm studying, and hopefully offer something useful to others along the way.

I'm still quite new to blogging, but I hope youâ€™ll find something here worth reading.

Thanks for stopping by!
